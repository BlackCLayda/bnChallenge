# BN Challenge

* a simple client-server application for uploading/downloading files. The application consists of two parts:
1. A client, which can select a file and upload it to the server. A client can download the previously uploaded file from the server.
2. A server, which receives files from clients, and serves the files back to them upon request.

* The application only supports txt and pdf files so far. 
* Note that if you use an IDE, the client and the server are two different projects


#### Used Tech :computer:

*  Eclipse [IDE] : used to build the project
*  Java  [Programming Language] : used to code the entire project
*  javax.crypto [Java_Library] : used to encrypt the client's file.

####  Prerequisites

* To run the program you need to have [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) downloaded and installed. 
* If you want to use an IDE, download and install it. Eg: [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

#### What's next ▶️ 

* Add a Javadoc.
* Web and/or Desktop interface.
* Add command to list available files specific to each client.
* Secure the encryption key. 
* Support more file types.
